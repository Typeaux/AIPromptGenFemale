# Random Prompt Generator

This Python script generates random prompts by selecting items from predefined categories. Each category contains a list of items from which one is randomly chosen to create a prompt. The generated prompt is displayed in a graphical user interface (GUI) and can be copied to the clipboard for further use.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using Python.
2. **Select Categories**: For each category, choose an item from the dropdown menu. You can also leave the dropdown blank to randomly select an item from that category. Additionally, you can disable a category by unchecking the "Disable/Enable" checkbox next to it. Disabled categories will be omitted from the prompt generation.
3. **Generate Prompt**: Click the "Generate" button to create a random prompt based on your selections.
4. **Copy Prompt**: Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the generated prompt to the clipboard.

Dropdown menus allow you to choose specific items for each category, while the "Disable/Enable" checkboxes allow you to control whether a category is included in the prompt generation. If a category is disabled, it will be ignored when generating the prompt.
